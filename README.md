# Graph-Based-Image-Segmentation
This a C++ reimplementation of the papaer **efficient graph-based image segmentation**. I just change the code in [https://github.com/congve1/SaliencyRC](https://github.com/congve1/SaliencyRC) from python to C++. Besides, I use the count sort method in the sorting step,so my code can process a 1200 X 800 image within 2s and a 1900 X 1500 iamge at about 36s. 

There are many strings "heheXX" in my code, they are my debug flag.  :)

All you need is to change the image path and config the opencv environment.
